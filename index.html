            <h1>What are birds?</h1>
            Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers,toothless beaked jaws,
            the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 
            Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m common ostrich. There are over 11,000 
            living species and they are split into 44 orders. More than half are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose 
            development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, 
            which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in 
            some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds 
            are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, 
            have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.

            We often think of birds as eating seeds and fruits — it’s what they come to our yards for after all — but many birds also rely on insects for a large part of their nutrition. It’s this part of their diet that does us a big favor in the form of free pest control. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By eating insects, birds help keep the bug populations from becoming too large, so having them nearby is a good thing. All told, birds eat between 450 million tons and 550 million tons of insects each year, USA Today reports(Opens in a new window). While this helps us around our homes and neighborhoods, it’s also a boon to farmers as well, assisting to control agricultural pests. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s not just insect-eating birds we owe a debt of gratitude to. Many raptors — owls, hawks, eagles and falcons — are at the top of the food chain and help keep the ecosystem in balance through their regular hunting activities, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation(Opens in a new window). Without them, our environment could become overpopulated with some of the creatures they frequently hunt, namely rodents and other small mammals.

            Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[12] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[13] on the principle that a clade based on extant species should be limited to those extant species and their closest extinct relatives.
